# Hideous-Wanderer
Hideous Wanderer is a mod for Wolfenstein3D, specifically the sourceport ECWolf, based on the mod for Doom of a similar name, Hideous Destructor.

It aims to make the game a little bit milsim/tac-shootery. It gives weapons a more real-world accurate feel, including more realistic firerate and damage, and adding reloading.


FEATURE GUIDE for HWand

  I. WEAPONS
You start with the Knife and the Pistol.

---KNIFE---
A simple knife. It has your loose rounds ammo counter.
Fire to stab. It's more powerful than the standard Wolf3D knife. 

---PISTOL---
The standard issue pistol. It's a Luger 9mm semi auto handgun. Luckily the clips for it are really hard to accidentally drop and really fast to reload.
Fire to shoot. Altfire to reload.

On top of that, there are a few weapons that you'll find around.

---SMG---
A fully suppressed sub-machine gun. Fully suppressed, fully automatic, fully inaccurate. Less accurate than the pistol, but it has a large mag capacity and deals more damage per shot. On top of that, if you can manage to stealth kill your target, it might not alert anybody.
Fire to shoot, altfire to reload.

---CHAINGUN---
The ultimate swiss cheesifying tool. It fires incredibly fast, and deals a fuck-ton of damage per round, but absolutely guzzles ammo. It's capable of killing heavily armored soldiers incredibly quickly.
Fire to shoot, altfire to reload.



KNOWN ISSUES as of HIDEOUS WANDERER ALPHA01

=-=Crashes=-=

1. When reloading from empty, if you pick up a mag during the reload sequence,
the game hard-crashes.

2. If you reload from empty but don't have anything to put into the gun, the
game crashes for some reason. Note that this is rather inconsistent.

WARNING:
RELOADING FROM EMPTY IN GENERAL IS VERY BUGGY. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THAT YOU 
LET YOUR GUNS HIT EMPTY, AND BY NO MEANS SHOULD YOU RELOAD WITHOUT ANY BULLETS
IN YOUR INVENTORY. IT IS ALSO EVEN BUGGIER WHEN YOU TRY TO CHEAT IN GOODIES.

NOTE: The previous two bugs have not been confirmed for the Chaingun.


=-=General Bugs=-=

1. The SMG has no pickup sprite. (fixed)

2. If you run out of loose bullets or pick up too many, the ammo counter 
(displayed on the knife) will disappear.
