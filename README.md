# Hideous-Wanderer
Hideous Wanderer is a mod for Wolfenstein3D, specifically the sourceport ECWolf, based on the mod for Doom of a similar name, Hideous Destructor.

It aims to make the game a little bit milsim/tac-shootery. It gives weapons a more real-world accurate feel, including more realistic firerate and damage, and adding reloading.


KNOWN ISSUES as of HIDEOUS WANDERER ALPHA01

=-=Crashes=-=

1. When reloading from empty, if you pick up a mag during the reload sequence,
the game hard-crashes.

2. If you reload from empty but don't have anything to put into the gun, the
game crashes for some reason. Note that this is rather inconsistent.

WARNING:
RELOADING FROM EMPTY IN GENERAL IS VERY BUGGY. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THAT YOU 
LET YOUR GUNS HIT EMPTY, AND BY NO MEANS SHOULD YOU RELOAD WITHOUT ANY BULLETS
IN YOUR INVENTORY. IT IS ALSO EVEN BUGGIER WHEN YOU TRY TO CHEAT IN GOODIES.

NOTE: The previous two bugs have not been confirmed for the Chaingun.


=-=General Bugs=-=

1. The SMG has no pickup sprite. (fixed)

2. If you run out of loose bullets or pick up too many, the ammo counter 
(displayed on the knife) will disappear.
